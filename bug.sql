In SQL, a common but often subtle error is caused by neglecting to handle NULL values appropriately.  For example, consider a query involving a `WHERE` clause that compares a column to a constant using the `=` operator:

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department_id = 10;
```

If the `department_id` column allows NULL values, and some employees have a NULL value in this column, they will be excluded from the results even if the intention was to include them. This is because `NULL` is not equal to any value, including itself.  The comparison `NULL = 10` evaluates to `UNKNOWN`, not `TRUE` or `FALSE`. 

Another problem arises with aggregate functions like `AVG()`.  If `AVG()` encounters `NULL` values in the input column, it will simply ignore them. While often desired, it can lead to inaccurate results if not correctly anticipated.  Likewise, `SUM()` ignores NULL values, which can be unexpectedly problematic when dealing with totals.

Furthermore, problems can occur when using `JOIN` operations.  If there's a `NULL` value in a join column, the row might not participate in the join, unexpectedly omitting data. 

The same applies to `WHERE` clauses with `LIKE` operator, which will not match rows with `NULL` values.
